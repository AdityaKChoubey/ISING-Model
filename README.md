# ISING-Model
This repository contains a Python-based simulation of the 2D Ising model, exploring phase transitions and magnetization behavior under different algorithms. The goal is to compare the efficiency and accuracy of various methods used to simulate spin dynamics in statistical physics.

You'll find implementations of several popular algorithms used to simulate the Ising model:

  Metropolis algorithm – The classic Monte Carlo method.

  Wolff algorithm – A cluster-based method that works well near criticality.

  Gibbs sampling (Heat Bath) – Spins are updated based on their neighbors' influence.


Features:
 Visualizations of the spin lattice as it evolves

 Plots for magnetization, energy, specific heat, and susceptibility

 Customizable parameters: lattice size, temperature, number of steps

 Clean code structure for extending or tweaking simulations
